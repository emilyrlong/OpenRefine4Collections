# OpenRefine for Collections Data Tutorial

## Getting Started

First, make sure you've read the [README](https://github.com/emilyrlong/OpenRefine4Collections/blob/main/README.md) in this GitHub to download OpenRefine and the collections data for this tutorial.

Open the OpenRefine app in a browser with the link: [http://127.0.0.1:3333](http://127.0.0.1:3333). In OpenRefine,...

### 1. Create a new project and upload the data
* Create Project > This Computer > Choose files
* Upload the [VA_CeramicObjects.csv](https://github.com/emilyrlong/OpenRefine4Collections/blob/main/VA_CeramicObjects.csv) file and hit ‘Next’

### 2. Change the project and data load settings
* Change the Project Name if you like
* Does the data look wonky? In the “CSV / TSV / separator-based files” tab, click
“commas (CSV)”
* Keep the “Trim leading & trailing whitespace...” button checked
* Make sure the Character Encoding is UTF-8
* Make sure that the “Parse Next _1_ line(s) as column headers” is checked
  * Note: If your CSV doesn’t have column names, un-check the “Parse Next _ line(s) as column headers” button, then you can add the column names in a list.
* Then click Create Project

### 3. Get familiar with viewing your data
You can view the rows in groups of 5, 10, 25 or 50, and use the previous/next buttons to move between row pages.

Most of OpenRefine’s tools can be found by clicking the drop-down arrows at the top of each column. Take a moment to check out some of the operations in the drop-down menu. The following are handy to know:
* Rename columns by clicking the drop-down menu arrow > Edit column > Rename this column
* Remove columns by clicking the arrow > Edit column > Remove this column
