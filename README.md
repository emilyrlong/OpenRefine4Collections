# OpenRefine4Collections
An OpenRefine workshop using the object data from the V&amp;A collections data API. This workshop was created by Emily Long for the MSc Data Science for Cultural Heritage course at UCL (Heritage Data Management module).

OpenRefine is a tool to clean up messy data. Itâ€™s similar to Microsoft Excel, but more powerful when it comes to cleaning messy strings. OpenRefine runs in a web browser like Chrome, but first you need to download OpenRefine to your computer.

## Download OpenRefine
OpenRefine can be downloaded from [their website](https://openrefine.org/download.html).
Further instructions on downloading can be found from the [University of Toronto library](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-installation-instructions).
Note that you may have issues opening OpenRefine on a Mac laptop initially because of the security settings. In that case, see the [Mac support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).
