# OpenRefine4Collections
An OpenRefine workshop using the object data from the V&amp;A collections data API. This workshop was created by Emily Long for the MSc Data Science for Cultural Heritage course at UCL (Heritage Data Management module).

OpenRefine is a tool to clean up messy data. It’s similar to Microsoft Excel, but more powerful when it comes to cleaning messy strings. OpenRefine runs in a web browser like Chrome, but first you need to download OpenRefine to your computer.

## Download OpenRefine
* OpenRefine can be downloaded from [their website](https://openrefine.org/download.html).
* Further instructions on downloading can be found from the [University of Toronto library](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-installation-instructions).
* Note that you may have issues opening OpenRefine on a Mac laptop initially because of the security settings. In that case, see the [Mac support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).

## Learning Objectives
The aim for students in this week’s workshop is to...
1. Learn some techniques for cleaning data in OpenRefine.
2. Understand some of the issues that arise in museum collection data.
3. Consider how data should be cleaned to facilitate further data management, analysis and visualisation.

## Resources
