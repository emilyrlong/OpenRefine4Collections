# OpenRefine4Collections
An OpenRefine workshop using the object data from the V&amp;A collections data API. This workshop was created by Emily Long for the MSc Data Science for Cultural Heritage course at UCL (Heritage Data Management module).

OpenRefine is a tool to clean up messy data. It’s similar to Microsoft Excel, but more powerful when it comes to cleaning messy strings. OpenRefine runs in a web browser like Chrome, but first you need to download OpenRefine to your computer.

## Learning Objectives
The aim for students in this week’s workshop is to...
1. Learn some techniques for cleaning data in OpenRefine.
2. Consider how data should be cleaned to facilitate further data management, analysis and visualisation.
3. Understand some of the data management issues that arise in museums.

## Download OpenRefine
* OpenRefine can be downloaded from [their website](https://openrefine.org/download.html).
* Further instructions on downloading can be found from the [University of Toronto library](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-installation-instructions).
* Note that you may have issues opening OpenRefine on a Mac laptop initially because of the security settings. In that case, see the [Mac support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).

## Resources
* The Library Carpentry [Open Refine tutorial](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/)
* OpenRefine documentation on [GREL functions](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/grelfunctions)

## V&A Collection Data
This workshop will use data from the [V&amp;A Collections API](https://developers.vam.ac.uk). 

For a short time, there will be a CSV file of collection data in this GitHub ([VA_CeramicObjects.csv](https://github.com/emilyrlong/OpenRefine4Collections/blob/main/VA_CeramicObjects.csv)). To download, go the csv file in GitHub, right-click on the Raw button, and select 'Download the Linked File' or 'Save Link As...'

But to make sure you're working with up-to-date data, you can download data from the API using the Python notebook ([VA Collections Data.ipynb](https://github.com/emilyrlong/OpenRefine4Collections/blob/main/VA_Collections_Data.ipynb)).  

## Getting Started
Open the OpenRefine app. It pops up as a tab in your default browser. If OpenRefine doesn’t open when you click on the app, or you want to work in OpenRefine in a browser that isn’t your default, just copy and paste this link: [http://127.0.0.1:3333](http://127.0.0.1:3333)
